# Week--8-Ansible-IAC-Terraforming-


## Topic Covered 
- Ansible 
- IOC (Infrastructure as code )
____

Goal:
try and connect to mutiple instances with one controller  instance 



# Ansible controller and agent nodes set up guide
- Clone this repo and run `vagrant up`
- `(double check syntax/intendation)`

## We will use 18.04 ubuntu for ansible controller and agent nodes set up 
### Please ensure to refer back to your vagrant documentation

- **You may need to reinstall plugins or dependencies required depending on the OS you are using.**

```vagrant 
# -*- mode: ruby -*-
# vi: set ft=ruby :

# All Vagrant configuration is done below. The "2" in Vagrant.configure
# configures the configuration version (we support older styles for
# backwards compatibility). Please don't change it unless you know what

# MULTI SERVER/VMs environment 
#
Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|

# creating first VM called web  
  config.vm.define "web" do |web|
    
    web.vm.box = "bento/ubuntu-18.04"
   # downloading ubuntu 18.04 image

    web.vm.hostname = 'web'
    # assigning host name to the VM
    
    web.vm.network :private_network, ip: "192.168.33.10"
    #   assigning private IP
    
    # config.hostsupdater.aliases = ["development.web"]
    # creating a link called development.web so we can access web page with this link instread of an IP   
        
  end
  
# creating second VM called db
  config.vm.define "db" do |db|
    
    db.vm.box = "bento/ubuntu-18.04"
    
    db.vm.hostname = 'db'
    
    db.vm.network :private_network, ip: "192.168.33.11"
    
    
    #config.hostsupdater.aliases = ["development.db"]     
  end

 # creating are Ansible controller
  config.vm.define "controller" do |controller|
    
    controller.vm.box = "bento/ubuntu-18.04"
    
    controller.vm.hostname = 'controller'
    
    controller.vm.network :private_network, ip: "192.168.33.12"
    
    #config.hostsupdater.aliases = ["development.controller"] 
    
  end

end
```

Type `vagrant status` in your terminal to check if all 3 vm's are running \
You should see this: 

```
web                       running (virtualbox)
db                        running (virtualbox)
controller                running (virtualbox)
```
